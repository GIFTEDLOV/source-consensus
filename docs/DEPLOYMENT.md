# Deployment

This is the pre-transaction deployment procedure. No transaction has been signed at Stage 4.

Target network: GenLayer Bradbury, chain ID `4221`. Before signing, verify the Bradbury RPC,
account provenance and balance, the final audited source hash, `genvm-lint check` and `validate`,
all tests and mutations, fixture and parity checks, and the source-size ceiling. Use one clean
canonical constructor configuration with three commit-pinned sources and an offline expected
`configuration_hash`. Deploy exactly one instance and persist the transaction hash immediately.

After finalization require `FINALIZED`, `FINISHED_WITH_RETURN`, deployed code, matching deployable
artifact hash, correct `get_config()` and `get_sources()`, matching `configuration_hash()`, and
`is_resolved() == false`. Re-fetch evidence, then perform exactly one `resolve()`. Verify its
finalized result, canonical record, all source buckets, unchanged configuration hash, validator
votes, and GEN cost. The Explorer URL will be recorded as
`https://explorer.genlayer.com/contract/<address>` after deployment.
